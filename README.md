# Motivation

* Improving the Secondary education experience (in Nigeria) using programming tools and platforms such as github, python, overleaf/LaTex & R Markdown.  

* Making Programming more inclusive for students with minimal opportunities/funding. 

* Increasing the amount girls and women involved in STEM.  


# Application and some of my thought process. 

* This is a heavily practice based learning environment. 

* Access to the solutions of exercises are dependent on two things (for now); the amount of time spent practicing the questions and not making progress, and the inputing an answer and the answer being within a specific range of the solution.
